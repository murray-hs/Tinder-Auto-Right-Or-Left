### My javascript level is: Advance Beginner. 
# Tinder-Auto-Right-Or-Left
Tinder Auto Right or Left based on Blacklist or Empty profile info.  
A lot of setting at the begging of the script.  ( tinder web )
This code was created only for educational / fun purposes.

### This script is based on https://github.com/jaflesch tinder-autolike 
- I got involved into this code just to learn more javascript.
- I made a lot of changes, and I didn't know how to update jaflesch repository and I don't how involved they are in this project.
- I also opened this repository to learn GITHUB and GITHUB collaboration. 

### How to use the script
- Access https://tinder.com
- And then depending on the website, go to https://tinder.com/app/recs or to https://www.okcupid.com/doubletake
- Open the browser's console
- Copy the JS file
- Run the script

I created a lot of settings to see on the console 

### there is room for improvement.

1 - check how many pictures and / or click on pictures.
2 - I noticed there are profile that received a lot of likes, tinder show the option to SUPER Like that profile. 
2.a auto click super like or not thanks button. if no thanks is clicked script will regular LIKE the profile
2.b I'd auto click No Thanks  ( Accessibility info:  Name:  NO THANKS  Role: button )
3 - I noticed that Recently Active notification is, sometime free and I also noticed ON LINE activity, But I do not see it all the time. 
3.a I added a code to checked Reciently Active, - I coudn't test it and maybe we can do the some with ON LINE activity. 
4 - I exit the script when Out of Like. it need Enhancement. 
5 - Update a blacklist for local driver instead from the script 
6 - Automatically change windows size or togle device.


### The Script works well when

open inspect 
togle device, and set to any device. 
*_you need to see just the profile and the buttons._*
*_The script won't work well_*
*_IF You see the LEFT side with My Profile, Matches, Messages, the the pictures of your matches._*

I was trying to automatically change windows size or togle device.

Last but not less. it will be great to create a Chrome extension to START and STOP the script. 
but I think the script needs to be redesing.... 
### Open to hear new ideas to create a Chrome Extension


### SOON I WILL UPLOAD THE CODE

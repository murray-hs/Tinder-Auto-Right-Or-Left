javascript script 
##### My javascript level is: Advance Beginner. | Last Updated: 2020-27-10  
- Script is located inside of Chrome Extension Folder. 
- Filename: 2020.js ( works )
 - Chrome Extension: work in progress... ( Extension is not working... correctly )
# Tinder Auto Right Or Left ( Tinder Sweeper, Tinder Auto Sweeper. Tinder Auto, Tinder Assistant, Tinder Auto Like or not ) 
* Tinder Auto Right or Left based on Blacklist or Empty profile information and other customized settings.  
* Seetings are located at the the begging of the script.  ( Tinder web )
* This code was created for educational and fun purposes.
* This script is based on https://github.com/jaflesch tinder-autolike 
* I got involved into this code just to learn more javascript.
* I've made a lot of changes, and I didn't know how to update jaflesch repository and I don't how involved they are in this project.
* I also opened this repository to learn GITHUB and GITHUB collaboration. 

### How to use the script
* Access https://tinder.com
* And then depending on the website, go to https://tinder.com/app/recs 
* Open the browser's console
* Copy the JS file
* Run the script

I created a lot of settings to see on the console 

### Room For Improvement.

* 1 - check how many pictures and / or click on pictures.
* 2 - I noticed there are profile that received a lot of likes, tinder show the option to SUPER Like that profile. 
  * 2.a auto click super like or not thanks button. if no thanks is clicked script will regular LIKE the profile
  * 2.b I'd auto click No Thanks  ( Accessibility info:  Name:  NO THANKS  Role: button )
* 3 - I noticed that Recently Active notification is, sometime free and I also noticed ON LINE activity, But I do not see it all the time. 
  * 3.a I added a code to checked Reciently Active, - I coudn't test it and maybe we can do the some with ON LINE activity. 
* 4 - I exit the script when Out of Like. it need Enhancement. 
* 5 - Update a blacklist for local driver instead from the script 
* 6 - Automatically change windows size or togle device.


### The Script Works Well When

Open inspect.

Togle device, and set to any device.

* You need to see just the profile and the buttons
```
The script won't work well 
IF You see the LEFT side with My Profile, Matches, Messages, the the pictures of your matches.
```
I'd like to automatically change windows size or togle device.

Last but not less. Create a Chrome extension to START and STOP the script. I'll upload what I have done so far
but I think the script needs to be redesing.... 
### Open to hear new ideas to create a Chrome Extension


#### Code will be Uploaded soon
